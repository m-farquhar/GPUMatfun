To use this collection of files:
1. Change the references to MATLAB and your compilers/libraries in the makefile to the versions you have installed

2. Put these files/folders in the folder you are working in
	laplacian.m
	http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27279-laplacian-in-1d-2d-or-3d/content/laplacian.m
	
	ellipkkp.m & ellipjc.m
	http://www.math.udel.edu/~driscoll/SC/

	minlin libary
	https://github.com/bcumming/minlin

3. run_results will generate results and figures from the paper
	figures and plots are based of parula colormap, so you will have to change this if not using MATLAB 2014b or later
	
4. to get just the table for comparisons between the CPU and GPU for computing one matrix function vector product
	run script_shifts (only needs to be run once to save files)
	then run run_script
